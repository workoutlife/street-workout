<p><strong>Should You Take Sarms Before Or After Workout</strong>, My thought process is that you want the drug binding to the receptors in your muscles during the times protein synthesis is highest. You can even take LGD-4033 either on a full or empty stomach though it is always suggested to take SARMs with meals and at least 30-45 minutes before workouts. Wouldnt it be the most beneficial to take a SARM after working out.</p>
