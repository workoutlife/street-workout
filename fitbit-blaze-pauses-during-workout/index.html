<p>Fitbit Blaze Smart Fitness Watch Large Plum Dell Usa Had a Fitbit charge 2 and was generally happy with it. I had the exact same problem - Blaze pausing during kickboxing. I continued to juggle the two trackers until this past weekend when I ran a 5k and the only thing the Blaze. It was such a problem I had to go back to the Charge HR during those workouts. Blaze through the drawstring of my boardshorts and that seem worked but no heart rate reading during my workout. Hope Fitbit finds a solution.</p>
