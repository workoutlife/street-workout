<p>I had the exact same problem - Blaze pausing during kickboxing. Blaze through the drawstring of my boardshorts and that seem worked but no heart rate reading during my workout. Hope Fitbit finds a solution. I just got a Versa as a gift and I am finding that during run workouts the app just randomly pauses. Had a Fitbit charge 2 and was generally happy with it.</p>
