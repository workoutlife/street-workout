<p>IMHO I can see people getting injured pretty easily on T25. But if you only have 25 minutes to work out its better than nothing. Koop Rechtstreeks bij de Fabrikant met een Eerlijke Prijs-kwaliteitsverhouding. T25 is a 70 day program and Insanity Max 30 lasts for 60 days. The T25 compared to Insanity Max 30 is less intense and lighter based on the length of the workout.</p>
<h3 id="well-it-really-depends-on-what-you-like">Well it really depends on what you like.</h3><p>That means no stretch no real discernable difference between the warmup and the workout even fewer breaks like noticeably fewer Insanity month 1 workouts actually feels easy to me now and overall I do think its starting to tax on my body in a way that regular Insanity did not. The first and most obvious distinction between FOCUS T25 and INSANITY is the duration of the workouts. With INSANITY you can expect to sweat for between 40 and 60 minutes most days of the week and longer on days that include an additional core workout. If you want to go crazy hard for 60 minutes and enjoy little breaks in between your workouts then definitely give Insanity a try. The T25 compared to Insanity Max 30 is less intense and lighter based on the length of the workout.</p>
