<p>Insanity Workout Review Physicalfitnessrx Com Insanity Workout Review in a few words. Supposedly unbiased reviews but wondering if I do try it. For the crazy insanity workouts you really need to refuel your body within an hour of finishing and making sure that whatever you do it - your body is getting enough fuel on board. P90X strongly recommends stretch cords or weights and the pull up bar which was the deal breaker for our house and doing the exercises together. A benefit to insanity.
