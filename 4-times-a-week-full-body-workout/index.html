<p>Muscle Building Splits By Jason Maxwell Don T Waste Your Time Doing A Bro Push Pull Workout Fitness Body Workout Routine A question for ya. All four weekly workouts. A question for ya. I wanna hit the gym 4 days a week and Ive currently been doing a split. Is it totally a dumb idea to do a full body routine 4x a week. The first workout of each week targets your chest and triceps the second your back and biceps the third your legs and chest and the fourth your back and shoulders.</p>
