<p>Core Work Part I Trx Workouts Trx Workout Plan Trx Straps My focus here is on workouts the natural bodybuilder can do at home with inexpensive equipment. Day 1 is an upper body push workout day 2 is an upper body pull workout. Bodybuilding doesnt have to be expensive or take a lot of time. A push workout a pull workout and a legs workout. The astute will notice that this is exactly the same as the intermediate gym workout except the three workouts are completed in 5 days instead of 7 days. This 3 day split workout is an excellent choice for intermediate lifters wanting to gain muscle and gain strength.</p>
