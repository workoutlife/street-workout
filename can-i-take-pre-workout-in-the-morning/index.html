No issues with working out fasted first thing in the morning. Research suggests that exercising on an empty stomach first thing in the morning ie in an overnight-fasted state for healthy young men may enhance training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle metabolic profile and mitigate against the negative consequences of short-term excess energy intake on glucose tolerance compared with exercising. When fasted and taking a pre I find it kicks in within 15-20 after taking it. A vast majority of the time thats the way I workout. For most people eating before a morning workout is optional and depends on your goals the type of workout youre doing and its duration.</p>
