<p><strong>Can I Take Pre Workout In The Morning</strong>, For most people eating before a morning workout is optional and depends on your goals the type of workout youre doing and its duration. No issues with working out fasted first thing in the morning. Research suggests that exercising on an empty stomach first thing in the morning ie in an overnight-fasted state for healthy young men may enhance training-induced adaptations in skeletal muscle metabolic profile and mitigate against the negative consequences of short-term excess energy intake on glucose tolerance compared with exercising.</p>
