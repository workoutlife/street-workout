<p>Pin On Health And Fitness 5 Turkish getups Work. This was a heavy compound lower body workout. 5 Turkish getups Work. I have sets of 10 15 and 20 lb dumbbells at home and some resistance bands and put together some workout routines over the past 18 months but it wasnt anything I was ever excited about. The only way exercise translates into long term health and fitness and the looks that come with it is if it is part of what you do and who you are are it is a habit. In our kettlebell world Prometheus is going to be your progression in strength.</p>
