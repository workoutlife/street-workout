<p><strong>Left Arm Tingling After Workout</strong>, In between are dozens of other potential causes. Arm exercises especially those to build the bicep put tremendous amounts of pressure on the brachial nerves located near the shoulder. As the muscle gets larger or engorged with blood it will put pressure on this nerve and you will get a pin pricking stinging numbing or numbness or even weakness in your arm.</p>
