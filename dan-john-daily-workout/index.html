<p>Dan John My Game Changers On Target Publications I had a nice compliment paid to me by a family member this weekend. Do a single rest a bit do a double rest a bit then do a triple. For a solid workout run through this three. A good question came up on the StrongFirst forum about the inclusion of something into the 40 Day Program It occurred. Dan John has a great program that Pavel Tsatsouline gave him years ago called The 40-Day Workout. The Forty Day WorkoutAgain.</p>
