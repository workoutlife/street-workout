<p>Its there to help your muscle endurance. I make my protein shake and pre workout night before so my morning goes super smooth. By taking it at the right time you neednt worry about a mid-run caffeine crash and thanks to the BCAAs it can. If you drink a pre-workout with 200-300 milligrams of caffeine without eating anything you can feel exactly the same way. Taking pre-workout before cardio is GREAT.</p>
