Advertentie RDX Jump Ropes Durability Comfort Guaranteed Starting From Just 899. Jumping rope is a full-body workout it burns a lot of calories in a short amount of time. I jump rope probably 3 times a week as part of either my lifting routine or a boxing workout. So if you jump rope for 20 minutes which is kind of what it felt I did for 1500 jumps that would equate to around 400 calories burned in each session or 2800 calories per week. Which is pretty awesome for just 20 minutes of exercise.</p>
