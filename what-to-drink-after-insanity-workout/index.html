<p>Insanity Calories Burned Calculator Insanitycalories Com Workout Results Insanity Workout Results Insanity Workout Motivation I am going to start insanity workout soon and i am so confused. If I do when do I take it. I dont know if i need to drink a protein shake or recovery formula after. I m going crazy cuz everyone says something different. As I understand it low-fat 1 chocolate milk has the perfect carbprotein ratio for an immediate post-workout drink. I dont even know the difference.</p>
