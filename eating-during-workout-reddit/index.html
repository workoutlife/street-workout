Ive tried eating directly before a workout to have some energy while I am dieting but now I feel that I need to eat during a workout to complete the workout. Ive never had a problem with not feeling fueled for my workouts until recently.</p>

<p>Muscle Building Full Body Workout 177 20190521114855 51 Muscle Building Routine Reddit News New Muscle Building Snac Muscle Building Women Upper Body Men Im looking at eating some egg whites in a sandwich as I transition from one exercise. So I typically wait 2hrs or maybe more if I ate a lot before working out. I need some perspective on this. My FTP took a big leap between SSB1 and SSB2 and the workouts. Eating during workout - bad idea. Play around with it and see what works for you.</p>

On the opposite if you eat so much that you get sleepy or have gastric problems during your workout you just ate.</p>
